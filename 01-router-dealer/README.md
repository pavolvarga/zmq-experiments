# ZMQ Router as Producer, ZMQ Dealer as Consumer

Try to reach the HMW state by sending messages from router / producer to delaer / consumer.<br/>
Both producer and consumer take several cmd arguments for configuration.<br/>
Run
```sh
   npm install
   node producer.js -h
   node consumer.js -h
```
to learn what can be set.<br/>
</br>
For starting the experiment start first the **producer** and then the **consumer**.
